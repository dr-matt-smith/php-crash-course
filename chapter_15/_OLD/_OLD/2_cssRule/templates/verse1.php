<blockquote>
    <strong>
    Verse 1:
    </strong>
    <br>
    Mary had a little lamb,
    <br>
    Its fleece was white as snow,
    <br>
    And everywhere that Mary went
    <br>
    The lamb was sure to go;
    <br>
    He followed her to school one day-
    <br>
    That was against the rule,
    <br>
    It made the children laugh and play
    <br>
    To see a lamb at school.
