<blockquote>
    <strong>
    Verse 2:
    </strong>
    <br>
    And so the teacher turned him out,
    <br>
    But still he lingered near,
    <br>
    And waited patiently about,
    <br>
    Till Mary did appear.
    <br>
    And then he ran to her and laid
    <br>
    His head upon her arm,
    <br>
    As if he said, "I'm not afraid-
    <br>
    You'll shield me from all harm."
