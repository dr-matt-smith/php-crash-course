<blockquote>
    <strong>
    Verse 3:
    </strong>
    <br>
    "What makes the lamb love Mary so?"
    <br>
    The little children cry;
    <br>
    "Oh, Mary loves the lamb, you know,"
    <br>
    The teacher did reply,
    <br>
    "And, you, each gentle animal
    <br>
    In confidence may bind,
    <br>
    And make it follow at your call,
    <br>
    If you are always kind."
